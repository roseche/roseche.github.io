   <title>The Impatience Phenomenon</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/street-lights-speed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Long exposure picture of street lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If good things come to those who wait, what comes to those who don’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-speed&quot;&gt;The need for speed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37100091&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article by the BBC&lt;/a&gt; notes that over half of us would not even wait three seconds for a site to load before giving up and going somewhere else. Three seconds is not very long at all. It is absurd to imagine that the average person would refuse to wait three seconds for more traditional services: a supermarket checkout, for example, or a bus. And yet, when it comes to a website, over half of us would not wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our collective impatience has a tangible business impact. The same article notes that online sales by retailer Nordstrom fell by 11% when its website response time was half a second slower - that tens of millions of dollars were lost over half a second of difference. Customers can’t be bothered to wait for slow sites to load, so they go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If customers want fast sites, that fast sites is what companies will build. Those with slow sites are literally left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-this-happen&quot;&gt;How did this happen?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘The last best experience anyone has anywhere becomes the minimum expectation for the experience they want everywhere.’ - Bridget van Kranlingen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t expect buses to come in under three seconds, because buses that we have waited for in the past have mostly taken longer. So we would probably not give up on a bus just because it hadn’t come in three seconds. But online, users are not used to waiting for longer than three seconds - they are exposed to sites that barely take any time at all to load. A fast-loading site is their minimum expectation, and as a result they are not willing to wait for a three-second site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development teams, in their effort to meet user demand, get caught in a vicious cycle. As they improve site performance to meet user expectation, user expectation gets higher and higher - meaning that their sites have to load even faster in order to retain users. The more they improve performance, the more users expect of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-offline&quot;&gt;Going offline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed and the expectation of speed are rising in the real world - we can see this most clearly when we look at hybrid online/offline services. A taxi that we order through an app takes only two minutes to arrive; a product that we order through a website is delivered the next day, or even the same day. Any longer, and it’s not what we’re used to - we expect better. Impatience, accelerated by technology, permeates our psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something particular about online impatience; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/why-speed-matters/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post by Google developers&lt;/a&gt; references a study that shows that stress incurred during loading time is greater than waiting in a checkout line at a physical shop. But as the division between online and offline becomes increasing blurred in our everyday lives, we have to wonder what the impact will be on our ability to exercise patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting is frustrating. But patience is a good thing; it teaches us to make mindful choices, to identify what we think is worth waiting for. But it is not patience, but impatience, to which digital technology panders. And perhaps impatience is like a muscle - the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Amazon Experience</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/09/the-amazon-experience"/>
   <updated>2020-09-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/09/09/the-amazon-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Amazon website is not pretty. Nor is it user-friendly. For a behemoth online retailer, this might seem surprising at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-review-amazon-vs-waterstones&quot;&gt;Design review: Amazon vs. Waterstones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon site flouts several basic design principles. It has poor visual hierarchy, for example. This means that the important elements on the page are not given due emphasis. When shopping for a book, the title and price of the book are two of the most important pieces of information. But in the screenshot shown below, you can see that the text size of the product title is smaller than the text size of the publication date, and that the price of the product is listed in small text sizes in boxes that are placed out of the way. These two key pieces of information are not appropriately emphasised. Contrast the way in which Waterstones displays the book on its site: both title and price can be viewed at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/amazon-screenshot-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Amazon product page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon product page: Sept. 9, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/waterstones-screenshot-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Waterstones product page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waterstones product page: Sept. 9, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Amazon page, competing elements are set besides each other. The page looked cluttered. The synopsis of the book is placed underneath four lines of information about delivery and collection; there is no title to distinguish these two topics from each other, nor is there the appropriate spacing. Again, contrast the way in which Waterstones displays the book’s synopsis: in a separate box, with a title and key summary presented in bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/amazon-screenshot-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Amazon product page: synopsis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon synopsis: Sept. 9, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/waterstones-screenshot-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Waterstones product page: synopsis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waterstones synopsis: Sept. 9, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-really-on-offer&quot;&gt;What’s really on offer?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Waterstones website is more user-friendly. But Amazon knows what it is good at. Notice that Amazon has knocked 24% off the recommended retail price of the book - making it 24% cheaper than what Waterstones are offering. Notice too that Amazon offers free (‘FREE’) delivery, with the option to add premium or even same-day delivery with Amazon Prime. User experience is an end-to-end operation; it goes beyond simply navigating the site. If a customer can receive an item quickly and cheaply, how much will it matter to them that the page that they bought it from looked a bit messy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/amazon-screenshot-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Amazon product page: key differentiators&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s key differentiators: price and delivery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-amazon-aesthetic&quot;&gt;The Amazon Aesthetic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon is a technology giant. So why does its retail site look so clumsy? I would be very surprised if the slapdash aesthetic of the site was anything but extremely deliberate - but I can only speculate as to the motives of Amazon’s designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis is that the product pages are designed to be confusing so that customers are driven to look around more. This may lead to increased engagement with advertisements. Customers may be more likely to divert their attention to the numerous ads around the page while they are concentrating on finding their way around. The ads are in unexpected places - not in a simple sidebar, which would be easy to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/amazon-screenshot-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Amazon product page: ads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nested cross-selling and up-selling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hypothesis is that the cluttered design makes the page feel purposefully cheap. The slapdash look marries nicely with Amazon’s bargain-shop branding: remember that Amazon were selling the same book for 24% cheaper than Waterstones. Customers may be encouraged by the cheap look of the page to remember Amazon as a cheap shop - meaning that they are more likely to look to Amazon for low prices in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bargain-shop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of bargain shop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bargain branding: the in-store equivalent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon employs thoughtful designers, who are more than capable of designing elegant websites; see their &lt;a href=&quot;https://amazon.design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;design community&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; sites for evidence. The retail site must be crude by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/amazon-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Amazon design page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon, but make it pretty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Amazon product page, distracting elements are introduced at the expense of design best practice - which favours beauty and minimalism. But the relationship between ‘good’ design and business outcomes is not always straightforward. Amazon’s site may look hastily designed - but actually, careful design decisions lie beneath the site’s shabby surface. In other words: don’t judge a book by its cover.&lt;/p&gt;
