The Amazon website is not pretty. Nor is it user-friendly. For a behemoth online retailer, this might seem surprising at first.

### Design review: Amazon vs. Waterstones

The Amazon site flouts several basic design principles. It has poor visual hierarchy, for example. This means that the important elements on the page are not given due emphasis. When shopping for a book, the title and price of the book are two of the most important pieces of information. But in the screenshot shown below, you can see that the text size of the product title is smaller than the text size of the publication date, and that the price of the product is listed in small text sizes in boxes that are placed out of the way. These two key pieces of information are not appropriately emphasised. Contrast the way in which Waterstones displays the book on its site: both title and price can be viewed at a glance.

On the Amazon page, competing elements are set besides each other. The page looked cluttered. The synopsis of the book is placed underneath four lines of information about delivery and collection; there is no title to distinguish these two topics from each other, nor is there the appropriate spacing. Again, contrast the way in which Waterstones displays the book’s synopsis: in a separate box, with a title and key summary presented in bold.

### What's really on offer?

The Waterstones website is more user-friendly. But Amazon knows what it is good at. Notice that Amazon has knocked 24% off the recommended retail price of the book - making it 24% cheaper than what Waterstones are offering. Notice too that Amazon offers free (‘FREE’) delivery, with the option to add premium or even same-day delivery with Amazon Prime. User experience is an end-to-end operation; it goes beyond simply navigating the site. If a customer can receive an item quickly and cheaply, how much will it matter to them that the page that they bought it from looked a bit messy?

### The Amazon Aesthetic

Amazon is a technology giant. So why does its retail site look so clumsy? I would be very surprised if the slapdash aesthetic of the site was anything but extremely deliberate - but I can only speculate as to the motives of Amazon's designers.

One hypothesis is that the product pages are designed to be confusing so that customers are driven to look around more. This may lead to increased engagement with advertisements. Customers may be more likely to divert their attention to the numerous ads around the page while they are concentrating on finding their way around. The ads are in unexpected places - not in a simple sidebar, which would be easy to ignore.

*Nested cross-selling and up-selling*

Another hypothesis is that the cluttered design makes the page feel purposefully cheap. The slapdash look marries nicely with Amazon's bargain-shop branding: remember that Amazon were selling the same book for 24% cheaper than Waterstones. Customers may be encouraged by the cheap look of the page to remember Amazon as a cheap shop - meaning that they are more likely to look to Amazon for low prices in future.

Amazon employs thoughtful designers, who are more than capable of designing elegant websites; see their <a href="https://amazon.design/" target="_blank">design community</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a> sites for evidence. The retail site must be crude by design.

### Conclusion

Across the Amazon product page, distracting elements are introduced at the expense of design best practice - which favours beauty and minimalism. But the relationship between ‘good’ design and business outcomes is not always straightforward. Amazon's site may look hastily designed - but actually, careful design decisions lie beneath the site's shabby surface. In other words: don't judge a book by its cover.
