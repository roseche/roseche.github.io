### Human-computer interaction

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction" target="_blank">Human-computer interaction</a> (HCI) is the study of how human users interact with computer technology - and vice versa. Crucial to this study are the related fields of behavioural science and design.

'Computer technology' describes an ever-expanding class of objects including, but not limited to: laptops, phones, tablets, and smart speakers. 

### Purpose of writing

Those of us who have more or less unrestricted access to technology spend much of the day interacting with machines. User experience is just life experience - work, entertainment, and relationships are all conducted at least in part through technology. 

This journal breaks down these experiences through the lens of HCI, and uses granular user interactions as springboards for exploring what modern life looks like more generally. It aims to be more mindful of what we do mindlessly. 

### The digital divide

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide" target="_blank">The digital divide</a> is the disparity in access to technology between different groups. It describes the gap not only in infrastructure, but also in digital skills. 

Although it is a relatively new kind of social inequality, it runs along existing lines: economic background, disability, race. As computers become increasingly enmeshed in the fabric of the world, we need to consider the impact of the digital divide on global inequality and the psychology of privilege.
